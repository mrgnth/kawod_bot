##What is this supposed to do:

2. Collect popular comments from /r/Entrepreneur (24h)
--> 3. Collect news stories on fair fashion
4. Collect twitter posts
5. Collect new blog posts from blog collection - Feeds parsen: http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/feedparser/using-feedparser-in-python
~~6. Check for dupes~~
~~7. Push them to DB~~

OOP-Redesign:
Post-Types are objects that can:
- get their data
- prepare their db commits
- fetch db-data for publishing
- return publish-ready formatted texts
